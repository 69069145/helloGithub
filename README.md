#Hello Github
This is my test Repository
Hey, My name is Harman
I am ECE MENG student at UBC
I found homework fairly okay as I did not encounter any difficulties
I managed to follow the clear instructions to make the changes 
I used the approach of pulling, then editing locally, saving , commit and then pushing to github
